# Python Practice Scripts

## Overview

This folder consists of two scripts that test basic aspects of programming in Python.

## Script Description

This project consists of two python scripts.

prime_ints.py tests the use of integer and boolean variables as well as for loops and if statements. The program prints out all prime integers between the numbers 3 and 100 inclusive.

word_file_manip.py tests the use of string variables, lists, and file manipulation (specifically file reading). The program first prints out the last 10 words/lines of the standard words file, then after an empty line prints out all of the words beginning with the letters "pyt".
